You need to download some files to follow this lesson.
If you are working on your local machine (Mac OS X/Linux),
you can simply follow these directions:

1. Download [shell-novice-data.zip]({{ site.github.url }}/data/shell-novice-data.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.
2. Unzip/extract the file (ask your instructor if you need help with this step). You should end up with a new folder called data-shell on your Desktop.
3. Open a terminal and type:

~~~
$ cd
~~~
{: .bash}

If you are working on the Palmetto cluster,
you will need to do the following:

1. Log in to the cluster
2. Type in exactly the following three commands:

~~~
$ cd
$ wget https://github.com/clemsonciti/linux-workshop/raw/gh-pages/data/shell-novice-data.zip
$ unzip shell-novice-data.zip
~~~
{: .bash}

In the lesson, you will find out how to access the data in this folder.
